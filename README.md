# root_console launcher for OSMC
This is a small laucher with a script to start a Virtual root-console

It stops kodi mediacenter and starts a console on your screen, without using putty or any other ssh client.
Right now it uses the same resolution that Kodi uses in your installation. Which means that if you use 1920x1080 the console text will be really small on your screen.

edit (8 years later):
Dependant on time, I vwill try to implement a resolution change or scaling to make it more readable on your TV.
